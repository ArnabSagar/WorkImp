# WorkImp


Project submission for Hack the northeast

Work in progress!! Check back later :)

This web browser extension forces you to improve your study habits, but not in the traditional manner.
Whenever you decide to slack off, WorkImp gets your ass back into gear by annoying you incessantly until 
you understand you don’t deserve to slack off while you’ve got work to get done. Let WorkImp know which 
websites are for work, and as long as you remain on those websites, it’ll leave you alone. The second you 
switch to a non-productive webpage, WorkImp will begin to play tricks on you, starting slow, and continuously 
incrementing the intensity and complexity of the tricks. If you stay focused, WorkImp might even reward you 
for your good habits!
